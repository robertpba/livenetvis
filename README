LiveNet Workspace Analyzer is a visualization tool for analyzing
and visualizing the network of workspaces in the LiveNet
workspace system. LiveNet in turn is a research prototype of a
web-based workspace management system developed at the University
of Technology, Sydney in Australia. (Not to be confused with many
other systems and websites called LiveNet.)

The LiveNet Workspace Analyzer is designed to connect to a
running LiveNet server's database, and then visualizes the
workspaces and their components (documents, participants, roles,
etc).

A demo mode exists which reads and visualizes serialized
workspace network data.

Running:

./gradlew demo

A screenshot showing the visualization window, control panel and
a colour legend panel is shown in screenshot.png .
